# thread-processing

Can someone make a frontend UI for this?

The page should have 2 text fields 
1. that accepts root directory (where to begin searching from)
2. fileName to be searched for. 

and 2 buttons 
1. use single thread processing
2. use multi thread processing

when the user clicks on any of the above 2 buttons, the integrated terminal (or terminal popup) should display the searching logs and at the end, show time it required to search the file(s). 

That's all. 

This is an owl in a tree and has nothing to do with this project, but I think it's pretty cool:



   ...    *    .   _  .
